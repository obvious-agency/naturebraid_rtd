# Tradeoff mapping equations and further detail

There are five different ways of calculating multiple service opportunities in the current version of Nature Braid:

- Equally weighted arithmetic
- Conservative
- Standard
- Weighted additive
- A combined "conservative and weighted additive" approach

For input into the tadeoff mapping, each service (*TS<sub>i</sub>*) takes a value of -1, 0, or 1

| Value | Meaning |
|--------------|-----------|
| -1 | Anticipated losses arising with change |
| 0 | No significant losses or gains associated with change |
| -1 | Gains ("wins") anticipated with change |

In the cases of both arithmetic and the standard calculations, both continuous and categorised tradeoff quantifications are calculated. In the case of the conservative and combined conservative/additive approaches, the calculations are by their nature categorised (ordinal) by definition.

For all the definitions following:
- *Noncat_OTS*: represents a normalised, continuous quantification
- *Cat_OTS*: the categorised (generally 5-way) value used for display

## Arithmetic calculations

The generic equation defining the arithmetic multiple criteria opportunity mapping is:
